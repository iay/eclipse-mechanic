_Ian's Workspace Mechanic tasks for Eclipse Juno_

This is an experiment in using the [Workspace Mechanic](http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/workspacemechanic/) plugin to automate the maintenance of my [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org) workspaces.  If you work with the [Shibboleth](http://shibboleth.net) source code, it may help to automate your workspace setup too.

I've recently stopped using a single monstrous Eclipse workspace with everything in it and moved towards using separate workspaces for each aspect of my work.  As a result I now have around a dozen workspaces on each of multiple machines, and getting consistent settings across all of them is a lot of work if done manually.  I'm too [lazy](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LazinessImpatienceHubris) for that, and Workspace Mechanic allows me to automate the setup of new workspaces as well as making it simpler to propagate settings changes across workspaces the next time I use each one.

When you install Workspace Mechanic, it starts out looking for tasks in a couple of well-known locations.  On the Mac, one of those is `~/.eclipse/mechanic/`.  This location has the advantage of being assumed for every workspace, but the disadvantage of being an all-or-nothing option.  You can tell Workspace Mechanic about any number of additional locations to consult for each workspace, so I've divided my tasks into directories:

* `/iay/` contains settings which are entirely personal; things like removing text from the perspectives bar and setting a non-US date format for Subversion history.  I soft-link this to `~/.eclipse/mechanic`.
* `/shib-required/` contains tasks for the "[Required Configuration](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/DEV/Configuring+Eclipse#ConfiguringEclipse-RequiredConfiguration)" settings for Shibboleth project work.  I use these for all of my workspaces, Shibboleth-related or not, as it turns out I quite like them.
* `/shib-recommended/` contains the corresponding "[Recommended Configuration](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/DEV/Configuring+Eclipse#ConfiguringEclipse-RecommendConfiguration)" settings.  Again, I use these for all my workspaces but you might want to be more selective.
* `/shib-repos/` contains a task for each of the Shibboleth subversion repositories.  I include this in all Shibboleth-related workspaces.  If your workspace already has the ones you need, you might want to avoid adding this directory, as it may duplicate some of the repository locations.  That doesn't seem to be harmful, though.

Setting up a new workspace therefore involves adding the `/shib-required/` and `/shib-recommended/` directories to the Workspace Mechanic preferences, and further adding `/shib-repos/` directory if the workspace is for Shibboleth work.
